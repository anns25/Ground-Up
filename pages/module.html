            <h2>Bridging the Triad of Therapist, Client and Medicine</h2>
            <p>Modile 1 supports therapist to guide clients deeply into their felt experience, both in Psychotherapy and
                Non ordinary experiences, as the pathway to deeper, more fundamental insights and subsequent change.</p>
            <p>The scope of module 1 is primarily on the preparation and integration of clients engaging in Psychedelic
                medicines.</p>
            <p>The macro learning outcome is the realigning of psychotherapeutic approach to match and support the
                Characteristics of the psychedelic experience; thus reorienting Mental Health practitioners from a top
                down (thinking) orientation to a bottom up (felt) orientation.</p>
            <p>In bridging the triad of Therapist Client and Medicine the learner will navigate 2 key directions</p>
            <ol>
                <li class="px-2 py-1 my-1">
                    Learning and applying psychotherapeutic skills, approaches, frameworks and lenses that support
                    clients to engage via a bottom up, feeling orientation whilst staying in direct relationship with
                    their own experience and the therapist.
                </li>
                <li class="px-2 py-1 my-1">
                    To support the therapist themselves to become more Felt lead, Bottom up and in relationship with
                    themselves and their clients.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>Aligning approach to medicine powerfully supports clients to better assimilate their non ordinary
                experiences into integrated wholes at the cognitive, somatic relational and spiritual level</p>
            <p>Being problem focused, cognitive, analytical and “client lead” are important and useful approaches in
                conventional Psychotherapy, although these largely Top-down approaches are insufficient when guiding
                clients through many or most forms of Psychedelic Assisted Psychotherapy.</p>
